We offer flexible payment options and scholarship opportunities. Contact us for detailed pricing and financial assistance options. We believe quality education is worth the investment."},{question:"What are the requirements to join?",answer:"You need basic English reading and writing skills, commitment to attend classes regularly for 6 months, and genuine interest in learning technology. We don't require previous computer experience - we'll teach you everything you need to know."},{question:"How do you help with finding jobs after graduation?",answer:"We provide resume assistance, interview practice, and introductions to employers in our network. However, we can't guarantee jobs - success depends on your effort during the program and job search. Most graduates find work within 6 months, but it takes persistence."},{question:"Can I join if I'm from outside Accra?",answer:"Our main programs are in-person in Accra, but we occasionally run workshops in other regions. We're working on online options but currently believe hands-on, in-person learning is most effective for our students."},{question:"What if I don't complete the program?",answer:"Life happens, and we understand that not everyone can complete the full 6 months. We work with students facing challenges, but if you need to leave, you're welcome to apply for future cohorts when your situation improves."},{question:"How competitive is the application process?",answer:"We have limited space (15-20 students per program), so we do have to select among applicants. We prioritize motivation and commitment over previous experience. Having clear goals and demonstrating dedication during the application process helps."}],i={hero:n,programs:e,contact:o,faq:t};export{i as c};
