    question: "What are the requirements to join?",

    question: "How do you help with finding jobs after graduation?",

    question: "Can I join if I'm from outside Accra?",
    answer: "Our main programs are in-person in Accra, but we occasionally run workshops in other regions. We're working on online options but currently believe hands-on, in-person learning is most effective for our students."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't complete the program?",
    answer: "Life happens, and we understand that not everyone can complete the full 6 months. We work with students facing challenges, but if you need to leave, you're welcome to apply for future cohorts when your situation improves."

  {
    question: "How competitive is the application process?",
    answer: "We have limited space (15-20 students per program), so we do have to select among applicants. We prioritize motivation and commitment over previous experience. Having clear goals and demonstrating dedication during the application process helps."
